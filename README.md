# Interactive JavaScript Asynchronous Examples

This repository contains an HTML page that demonstrates asynchronous JavaScript concepts in an interactive way. Users can view and run code directly on the page, similar to the functionality found on W3Schools.

## Contents

- **Synchronous vs Asynchronous Execution**:
    - Demonstrates the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code execution.
- **Handling Asynchronous Code**:
    - Shows how to handle asynchronous code using callbacks, promises, and async/await.
- **Event Loop, Call Stack, and Callback Queue**:
    - Visualizes how the JavaScript event loop and callback queue operate.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. For each example, you can see the code in a `textarea` block.
3. Click the "Run" button to execute the code, and the output will appear below.
4. The examples are organized in sections to correspond to specific slides in a presentation on JavaScript asynchronous execution.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the interactive JavaScript examples.

## Sections

- **Slide 3**: Synchronous vs Asynchronous
- **Slide 4**: Handling Asynchronous Code
- **Slide 5**: Event Loop, Call Stack, Callback Queue

## Running Locally

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser to view and interact with the examples.

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd repository_name
open index.html
```
